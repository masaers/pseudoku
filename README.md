# pseudoku
My sudoku skills formalized with my programming skills.

This project is on a hiatus since I implemented Peter Norvig's solution, which is super fast (especially with my data structures :-) ).

## Building
To build this project, clone it from git (or download and unpack) into a directory, run make from that directory and then feel free to try it with the sudoku problems in `data`.

Example:
```
git clone [URL]
cd psudoku
make
time build/sudoku < data/norvig_hard1.txt
```
